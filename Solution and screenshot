First I noticed that the name string was being converted to an integer.
This integer is equal to the sum of the decimal values of each character's equivalent upper case character. 
This sum was then 'xor-ed' with the value 0x5678. 
This value is the value to which the serial number must match after being 'xor-ed' with 0x1234. 
Applying the rules, the xor-ed name xor 0x1234 produced the required serial number once it was converted to decimal.
